"Free" Reverse shock means the amplitude and peak time can vary. All others fixed. "Fixed" means that the peak time is constrained.
For the forward and nonrel components, "free" means the spectral indices are allowed to vary freely.
1. Free rev + free forward
2. Fixed rev + free forward
3. Fixed rev + fixed forward (spectrum 1)
4. Fixed rev + free forward + free nonrel
5. Fixed rev + fixed forward + free nonrel
6. Fixed rev + fixed forward but DSPL (spectrum 1 only but with dsbpl)
7. Fixed rev + Fully modelled spectrum 1 into 2 
8. Fixed rev + fixed forward + fixed nonrel
9. Free rev + fully modelled spectrum 1 into 2
